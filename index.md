### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was one of my favorites because I was able to use all the skills I had practiced using 2 files to complete my project. By using two files I was able to use the function file to define the functions in the main file to be easier to maintain. I was able to practice creating and using 2D vectors, and using nested if loops in nested for loops, classes and other tools. Using these tools I was able to code an animated GIF image using three different colors in part 1. These tools also helped me accomplish to create an image with colored pixels, using many individual images in part 2. 

* Lab 5

    In lab 5, part 3 was coding the game Blackjack which I never knew how to play so it was interesting to know how the game works, inside and out. I was able to start using different variations of if statements for the different outcomes there could be making sure the code worked through all the circumstances. Being able to learn how to assign variables for different types also helped me to learn how to use different types of operators and comparing variables to complete different operations as practiced in BlackJack.

* Lab 8

    In lab 8, part 3 is one of my favorites as well because I was able to print out a pumpkin carved animation from a file. I was able to read a file, make sure the file worked or was able to open and be able to use it to print out the animation. And what made this one of my favorite parts was the history of how coders didn't let technology stop their creativity to create images so they used characters and symbols.
