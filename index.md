### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    In lab 3, part 3 was one of my favorites because I were able to use all the skills I had worked on previously to make a game. I was able to validate the arguments the users input and if they guessed correctly a secret number they won. And what made it more interesting is I was able to use if statements to see if the second user guessed higher or lower than the secret number, and then give them a hint and a second try.

* Lab 5

    In lab 5, part 3 was coding the game Blackjack which I never knew how to play so it was interesting to know how the game works. I was able to start using different uses of if statements for the different outcomes there could be making sure the code worked through all the circumstances. Being able to learn how to assign variables for different types also helped me to learn how to use different types of operators and comparing variables to complete different operations as practiced in BlackJack.

* Lab 8

    In lab 8, part 3 is one of my favorites as well because I was able to print out a pumpkin carved animation from a file. I was able to read a file, make sure the file worked or was able to open and be able to use it to print out the animation. And what made this one of my favorite parts was the history of how coders didn't let technology stop their creativity to create images so they used characters and symbols.
